I assigned 2 tickets to you

they are related

the one is very simple, just remove the sign up button from the user profile page

and remove any code on that page and the related proc page that references mailchimp

the other one is to change the release notice mailing list signup link to go to hubspot instead of mailchimp

should also be easy

the only tricky part is that you pass the current domain as a parameter in the link and you need to make sure it actually uses the current domain

this is because we allow clients to have custom domains, for example, globalmeet.admin.webcasts.com instead of admin.webcasts.com

this is noted in the ticket already

unrelated to this ticket, but just so you know. The same thing can be done with the viewer domain, for example, globalmeet.webcasts.com instead of event.webcasts.com (edited) 

and for reference, these are just domain names, they point to the same servers as the regular domain names

===================



As a marketer, I need to manage contacts and mailing lists for different communication types within one CRM platform.

Description: 

Replace the existing Mailchimp embedded form with the new Hubspot one in our release alert sign-ups. Embed code included below.

This alert appears at the top of the admin login screen when there is a release window blocked out on the system (Chuckmode). The Notify Me button points to this page https://admin.webcasts.com/sc/update_mailinglist.jsp  



We currently pass the referring admin domain URL like this to be used by Mailchimp to separate lists and should continue to do so for use by Hubspot:

https://admin.webcasts.com/sc/update_mailinglist.jsp?site=admin.webcasts.com

https://globalmeet.admin.webcasts.com/sc/update_mailinglist.jsp?site=globalmeet.admin.webcasts.com

 

Here is the Hubspot form embed code:



<script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js"></script>
<script>
  hbspt.forms.create({
    region: "na1",
    portalId: "24480249",
    formId: "fee0312c-c05d-4c8e-9f37-d725d2d5ddac"
  });
</script>


Here's the direct link to the same Hubspot form: https://share.hsforms.com/1_uAxLMBdTI6fN9cl0tXdrAekp2x

We will test this on alpha/beta to ensure that Hubspot is receiving the required information.

 
==================
Acceptance Criteria:
Ensure that 

the new form is loading correctly

the form page URL still contains the parameter for the referring URL, ex. https://globalmeet.admin.webcasts.com/sc/update_mailinglist.jsp?site=globalmeet.admin.webcasts.com

Work with marketing to test that

data is being passed to Hubspot correctly

they can use the URL and/or email address of the registrant to route the signup to the appropriate list
